Generates storyboard-like animations from audio and text scripts using natural language processing.

## Possible ideas...
- Implement both a script + audio and audio only method
- Can we build a system for multiple users (e.g. a podcast with multiple participants, etc.)
- For the script + audio version, we can parse for particular images 
- Live streaming version
